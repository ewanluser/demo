# Project Management Guidelines

## Task Management

- **Issue Tracking**: Use GitHub Issues to track all tasks, features, and bugs.
- **Kanban Board**: Utilize GitHub Projects (or a similar Kanban board) to visualize and manage the workflow (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).
- **Task Definition**: Each issue should have:
    - A clear and concise description.
    - Well-defined acceptance criteria.
    - An assigned priority level.

## Issue Categorization

- **Labels**: Use labels to categorize issues effectively. Standard labels should include:
    - `bug`: For defects and errors in the code.
    - `enhancement`: For new features or improvements to existing functionality.
    - `documentation`: For tasks related to writing or updating documentation.
    - `question`: For items that require discussion or clarification.
    - `priority: high`, `priority: medium`, `priority: low`: To indicate urgency.

## Milestone Management

- **Release Planning**: Use GitHub Milestones to plan for version releases and group related issues.
- **Milestone Goals**: Each milestone should have a clear set of objectives and a due date.
- **Progress Review**: Regularly review milestone progress to ensure timely releases and identify potential roadblocks.

## Communication and Collaboration

- **Transparent Communication**: Maintain open and transparent communication within GitHub Issues and Pull Requests.
- **Decision Logging**: Document all significant decisions and their rationale in the relevant issue or a designated documentation file.


- **Mentions**: Use `@mentions` to notify and involve relevant team members in discussions.
